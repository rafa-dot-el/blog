	abstract = {This review develops the hypothesis that a metabolite of leucine termed β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB) plays a key role in animal metabolism and that in certain circumstances insufficient amounts of HMB are either consumed in the diet or produced endogenously to supply tissue needs. The origin and metabolism of HMB is reviewed including the role of HMB in cholesterol biosynthesis. HMB feeding studies in animals are reviewed, which indicate that dietary supplementation of HMB can improve immune function and health and can increase the fat content of milk in lactating animals. Seven human studies are reviewed where HMB was fed. The results of both animal and human studies indicate that dietary supplementation of HMB is safe, as evidenced by lack of physical adverse effects and a lack of effect on blood hematology and chemistry. The only consistent change in blood chemistry was a decrease in LDL cholesterol, which changed 7\% (P {\textless} .01). In humans undergoing resistance training, HMB supplementation increased lean mass gains from 50 to 200\%, with similar percentage increases in strength when compared with unsupplemented subjects. The effects of HMB on muscle size and function seems to result from a diminution of exercise-related muscle damage and muscle protein breakdown. A general hypothesis is proposed that HMB is metabolized to HMG-CoA in tissues such as muscle, mammary tissue, and certain immune cells and is used for de novo cholesterol synthesis. In times of stimulated growth and/or differentiation. HMG-CoA may be rate-limiting for cholesterol synthesis, which could limit cell growth or function. It is proposed that feeding HMB can provide a saturating source of cytosolic HMG-CoA for cholesterol synthesis and in turn allow for maximal cell growth and function.},

	abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the world\&rsquo;s most important challenges for global public healthcare. Various studies have found an association between severe vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19-related outcomes. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in immune function and inflammation. Recent data have suggested a protective role of vitamin D in COVID-19-related health outcomes. The purpose of this meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA) was to better explain the strength of the association between the protective role of vitamin D supplementation and the risk of mortality and admission to intensive care units (ICUs) in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched four databases on 20 September 2022. Two reviewers screened the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and assessed the risk of bias, independently and in duplicate. The pre-specified outcomes of interest were mortality and ICU admission. Results: We identified 78 bibliographic citations. After the reviewers\&rsquo; screening, only five RCTs were found to be suitable for our analysis. We performed meta-analyses and then TSAs. Vitamin D administration results in a decreased risk of death and ICU admission (standardized mean difference (95\% CI): 0.49 (0.34\&ndash;0.72) and 0.28 (0.20\&ndash;0.39), respectively). The TSA of the protective role of vitamin D and ICU admission showed that, since the pooling of the studies reached a definite sample size, the positive association is conclusive. The TSA of the protective role of vitamin D in mortality risk showed that the z-curve was inside the alpha boundaries, indicating that the positive results need further studies. Discussion: The results of the meta-analyses and respective TSAs suggest a definitive association between the protective role of vitamin D and ICU hospitalization.},

	abstract = {Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have revealed that faces and words show a robust difference in the lateralization of their N170. The present study investigated the development of this differential lateralization in school-age boys. We assessed the potential role of fetal testosterone (FT) level as a factor biasing the prenatal development of lateralization, and the role of reading skill and Verbal IQ as factors predicting left lateralization for words in childhood. The adult pattern of differential N170 lateralization for faces and words was not present in a group of 26 school-age boys. This suggests that N170 lateralization only appears with years of experience with these stimulus categories or with late childhood maturation. FT level measured by amniocentesis did not account for a significant part of the individual variability in lateralization. Verbal IQ correlated with the degree of left lateralization of the N170 to words, but this effect was not specific to language abilities and language lateralization. A strong correlation was observed between the degree of left lateralization for words and the degree of left lateralization for faces, and both lateralization scores correlated with Verbal and Performance IQ. Possible explanations for these results are discussed along with ERP correlates of words and faces in school-age boys.},

	abstract = {The relationship between serum total testosterone (T) concentration and fluid intelligence (nonverbal, spatial) was studied in consistently right-handed men with successful (S) or unsuccessful educational levels (NS). Hand preference was assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Nonverbal intelligence was measured by Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test. Serum T level was determined using chemiluminescence enzyme-immunoassay on hormone autoanalyzer. There was no significant difference between the mean T levels of the S subjects and NS subjects, although S-men tended to have higher T levels than NS-men. The mean IQ was found to be significantly higher in S-men than NS-men. In the total sample (S + NS men), the correlation between T to IQ was best described by a polynomial regression (3rd order), exhibiting an inverse U-shaped regression. In S-men, the relationship between T and IQ was best described by a polynomial regression equation of the 3rd order; however, the relationship was not U-shaped, but rather a positive correlation (low T: low IQ and high T high IQ). In NS-men, there was an inverse U-shaped correlation between T and IQ (low and very high T: low IQ and moderate T: high IQ). The present data suggest that (i) very low and very high serum T concentrations may be disadvantageous, (ii) moderate T levels may be advantageous for general fluid intelligence, and (iii) a prewired cerebral organization may be essential for the T effects on cognitive abilities.},

The said drug has been shown to restore the lean body mass, to prevent osteoporosis and to correct the impaired immune response, but only few studies have evaluated the effect of the same on fracture healing. METHODS: Fracture was produced by an impact device in 24 rabbits which were divided into experimental (I) and control (II) groups of 12 animals each. The experimental groups were further divided into the subgroups IA and IB of equal animals, which received Nandrolone Decanoate 10 mg/kg intramuscularly, biweekly for 2 weeks and 4 weeks respectively. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Radiographs taken on the post fracture day15 and 40 showed better healing in the Nandrolone Decanoate administrated groups as a dense periosteal bone formation and prevention of the local osteoporosis. Histochemical examination of the callus and high serum alkaline phosphatase levels on day 15 and 40 confirmed better mineralization in experimental animals.},

METHODS: Male rats were assigned to four groups (n=28/group): Control group consisting of animals without any intervention, Nandrolone decanoate (DN) group consisting of animals that received intramuscular injection of nandrolone decanoate, Fracture group consisting of animals with a fracture at the mid-diaphysis of the femur, and Fracture and nandrolone decanoate group consisting of animals with a femur fracture and treatment with nandrolone decanoate. Fractures were created at the mid-diaphysis of the right femur by a blunt trauma and internally fixed using an intramedullary steel wire. The DN was injected intramuscularly twice per week (10 mg/kg of body mass). The femurs were measured and evaluated by densitometry and mechanical resistance after animal euthanasia. The newly formed bone and collagen type I levels were quantified in the callus. RESULTS: The treated animals had longer femurs after 28 days. The quality of the intact bone was not significantly different between groups. The bone callus did show a larger mass in the treated rats. CONCLUSION: The administration of nandrolone decanoate did not affect the quality of the intact bone, but might have enhanced the bone callus formation.},

	volume = {22},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate whether the use of our novel patient-specific guide (PSG) with 3-dimensional reconstruction in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) would allow accurate and reliable implantation of the glenoid and humeral components. METHODS: 20 fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were used. The PSG group (n=10) and conventional group (n=10) was evaluated the accuracy and reproducibility of implant positioning between before and after surgery on the computed tomography image. RESULTS: The superoinferior and anteroposterior offset in the glenoid component were 0.42 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.07, 0.50 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.08 in the conventional group and 0.45 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.03, 0.46 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.02 in the PSG group. The inclination and version angles were -1.93° \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 4.31°, 2.27° \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 5.91° and 0.46° \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.02°, 3.38° \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 2.79°. The standard deviation showed a smaller difference in the PSG group. The anteroposterior and lateromedial humeral canal center offset in the humeral component were 0.45 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.12, 0.48 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.15 in the conventional group and 0.46 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.59 (p=0.794), 0.46 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.06 (p=0.702) in the PSG group. The PSG showed significantly better humeral stem alignment. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PSGs with 3-dimensional reconstruction reduces variabilities in glenoid and humerus component positions and prevents extreme positioning errors in RTSA.},

	abstract = {Characterized by low serum testosterone levels and diverse symptoms, male hypogonadism is a common condition. Current medical treatment focuses on testosterone supplementation using multiple modalities such as injections, gels and pellets. Interestingly, while testosterone is considered an anabolic androgenic steroid, it has not been saddled with the social stigma that other, similar medications have. The goal of this review is to highlight an anabolic steroid, 19-nortestosterone (i.e., nandrolone, deca-durabolin) and illustrate prospective therapeutic applications for male health. Containing a chemical structure similar to testosterone, nandrolone has a higher myotrophic: androgenic ratio resulting in improved effects on muscle mass. Animal models have suggested application in the improvement of joint healing following rotator cuff repair. Minimal literature exists regarding the use of nandrolone and, as such, further human studies are required.},

	volume = {8},
	copyright = {http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions\#vor},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nandrolone decanoate (ND) is an anabolic-androgenic steroid, and its indiscriminate use leads to subclinical alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and androgen-dependent organs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of ND, either alone or in combination with resistance exercise (RE), on the levels of sex hormones, converting enzymes, and steroid receptors and the morphology of the ventral prostate (VP) in adult and aged rats. METHODS: Forty Sprague-Dawley adult and aged rats were divided into four groups each, sedentary and trained with and without ND. The groups received treatments over 8 weeks. Adult animals were sacrificed immediately following treatment completion, while the aged groups were left untreated until 300 days of age. RESULTS: Adult and aged animals showed reductions in testosterone levels following the different treatments, and 17β-estradiol levels were decreased in the ND-treated groups. The level of 5α-reductase type 2 (5αR2) and aromatase was increased significantly in the prostates of adult animals that performed RE. However, aromatase levels were decreased in the prostates of aged animals that performed RE and were treated with ND, while 5αR2 levels were reduced in aged animals that performed RE without ND treatment. When sex receptors levels were examined, the aged and trained animals presented low androgen receptor (AR) levels. Estrogen receptors (ERs) levels were increased in the prostates of adult animals that received ND. ERβ levels were reduced after treatments in aged animals. The heights of the prostatic epithelium were reduced in all adult treated animals, coinciding with increases in PCNA and PAR4 levels. DISCUSSION: ND and RE alter the levels of hormone, converting enzymes, and sex steroid receptors and the morphology of the VP. These effects were observed in both adult and aged rats. CONCLUSION: ND, either with or without RE, during post-puberty stage is able to interfere with the morphophysiology of the prostate.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the relationship between markers of vitamin B12 status and brain volume loss per year over a 5-year period in an elderly population. Methods: A prospective study of 107 community-dwelling volunteers aged 61 to 87 years without cognitive impairment at enrollment. Volunteers were assessed yearly by clinical examination, MRI scans, and cognitive tests. Blood was collected at baseline for measurement of plasma vitamin B12, transcobalamin (TC), holotranscobalamin (holoTC), methylmalonic acid (MMA), total homocysteine (tHcy), and serum folate. Results: The decrease in brain volume was greater among those with lower vitamin B12 and holoTC levels and higher plasma tHcy and MMA levels at baseline. Linear regression analysis showed that associations with vitamin B12 and holoTC remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, creatinine, education, initial brain volume, cognitive test scores, systolic blood pressure, ApoE ε4 status, tHcy, and folate. Using the upper (for the vitamins) or lower tertile (for the metabolites) as reference in logistic regression analysis and adjusting for the above covariates, vitamin B12 in the bottom tertile (\&lt;308 pmol/L) was associated with increased rate of brain volume loss (odds ratio 6.17, 95\% CI 1.25–30.47). The association was similar for low levels of holoTC (\&lt;54 pmol/L) (odds ratio 5.99, 95\% CI 1.21–29.81) and for low TC saturation. High levels of MMA or tHcy or low levels of folate were not associated with brain volume loss. Conclusion: Low vitamin B12 status should be further investigated as a modifiable cause of brain atrophy and of likely subsequent cognitive impairment in the elderly.
