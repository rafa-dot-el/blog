Waydroid is an /Android in a Container/ solution for Linux. Waydroid uses
Linux namespaces (user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc) to run a full Android
system in a container and provide Android applications on any GNU/Linux-based
platform (arm, arm64, x86, x86-64). The Android system inside the container
has direct access to needed hardware through LXC and the binder interface.

Unfortunately, Waydroid is only available for =Wayland=, and due to reasons
[fn:1] I use =X11=.

* Installation
On =NixOS= everything is =Nix= code, so the following shows the code for
installing /Waydroid/.

#+begin_src nix
virtualisation.waydroid.enable = true;
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
        weston # Waydroid requirement
];
#+end_src

After a system rebuild, Waydroid requires initialization. There are two
options: a vanilla version of Lineage OS, or a version that comes with =GAPPS=.
For the vanilla version:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
sudo waydroid init
#+end_src

For the =GAPPS= version:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
sudo waydroid init -f -s GAPPS -v https://ota.waydro.id/vendor -c https://ota.waydro.id/system
#+end_src
* Starting the environment

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
sudo systemctl start waydroid-container
weston &
#+end_src

Within =Weston= open a terminal and execute:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
waydroid session start &
waydroid show-full-ui
#+end_src
* First time manual setup
During the first boot, the system will have a completely new and fresh
install of Android (Lineage OS). I recommend [[https://docs.waydro.id/faq/disable-on-screen-keyboard][disabling the on-screen keyboard]]
and creating a shared folder from the host to the container:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
sudo mount --bind ~/Downloads ~/.local/share/waydroid/data/media/0/Download
#+end_src

* Stopping the environment
If for some reason you require restarting or stopping the environment,
within =Weston= execute:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
waydroid session stop
#+end_src

For a full stop of the container execute the following:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
sudo systemctl stop waydroid-container
#+end_src
* Appendix
** Full code in a module
The following shows the implementation of the code above, but this version is
written as a =Nix= module which can be incorporated and activated with
all the required dependencies. One of the advantages of modules is the
flexibility of toggling features on and off in the main configuration
according to environment, user or platform.

#+begin_src nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

with lib;

let cfg = config.rafa.features.virtualisation.android;
in {
  options.rafa.features.virtualisation.android = mkOption {
    type = types.bool;
    default = false;
    description = "Enable simple Android virtualisation features.";
  };
  config = mkIf cfg {
    virtualisation.waydroid.enable = true;
    environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
      weston # Waydroid requirement
    ];
  };

  meta = { maintainers = with lib.maintainers; [ rafa-dot-el ]; };
}
#+end_src
** Forcing a manual data cleanup
In case the system reaches a state where you require starting over, consider
manually removing all files from the following directories:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
sudo rm -r /var/lib/waydroid/* ~/.local/share/waydroid
#+end_src
** Managing Applications Through the Command Line

Listing installed applications:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
waydroid app list
#+end_src

#+end_example

Installing an application from an =.apk= file (note the section above
regarding mapping directories):

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
waydroid app install </path/to/app.apk>
#+end_src

Launching an application:
#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
waydroid app launch <application package name>
#+end_src

As for example:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
waydroid app launch com.android.calculator2
#+end_src


** Start a shell within the container
In case a shell within the container is required, the following will enable
it:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim :async
sudo waydroid shell
#+end_src
** Google Play Certification
When launching Waydroid with GAPPS for the first time, you will be notified
that the device is not certified for Google Play Protect. You can follow the
instructions on screen to self-certify your device, or use the following
shortcut:

#+begin_src bash
sudo waydroid shell
#+end_src


Inside the shell run this command:

#+begin_src bash
ANDROID_RUNTIME_ROOT=/apex/com.android.runtime ANDROID_DATA=/data ANDROID_TZDATA_ROOT=/apex/com.android.tzdata ANDROID_I18N_ROOT=/apex/com.android.i18n sqlite3 /data/data/com.google.android.gsf/databases/gservices.db "select * from main where name = \"android_id\";"
#+end_src

Copy the resulting number and use it on the following website:
https://www.google.com/android/uncertified

Stop the container and wait a few minutes until the configuration is
propagated.
** Disable On-Screen Keyboard
Waydroid by default shows the Android virtual keyboard when selecting an
input field. To disable this and only use the physical keyboard, turn off the
following setting:

=Settings > System > Languages & input > Physical keyboard > Use on-screen keyboard=
* Future work
Make use of [[https://microg.org/download.html][=MicroG=]] instead of =GAPPS= due to licensing

[fn:1] I have been using X11 for most of my life and have no compelling
reasons to change and go through the hassle for no significant functionality,
performance or stability gain.
